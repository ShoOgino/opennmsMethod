	/**
	 * Native method implemented in C which provides an interface 
	 * to the lower-level RRD functions  
	 * 
	 * WARNING: The RRD C api (rrd_update(), rrd_create(), etc...) relies on 
	 * getopt() & therefore is not thread safe.  This method is therefore
	 * synchronized in order to prevent more than one thread access at a time.
	 * 
	 * @param cmd	RRDtool style command string to be executed.
	 *		Currently supported RRD commands are:
	 * 			'create' - calls rrd_create()
	 * 			'update' - calls rrd_update()
	 *			'fetch'  - calls rrd_fetch()
	 *
	 * @return array of Java String objects
	 *
	 * 		In the case of rrd_fetch() the returned String array
	 * 		has the following characteristics:
	 *
	 *		String[0] = error text if command failed or NULL if successful
	 * 		String[1] = for 'fetch' cmd: data source names
	 *  		String[2..n] = for 'fetch' cmd: retrieved data rows for each 
	 * 				interval between start and end parms
	 */
