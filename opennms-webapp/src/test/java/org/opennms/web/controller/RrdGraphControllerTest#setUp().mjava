		// parsing code which will assume something about when 'now' is, often the current day/week
		// If we're running around midnight and the Calendar gets created on one day and the parsing
		// happens on the next, you'll get spurious failures, which would be really annoying and hard
		// to replicate.  Initial tests show that most tests take ~100ms, so if it's within 10 seconds
		// of midnight, wait for 30 seconds (and print a message saing why)
