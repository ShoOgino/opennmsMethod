     * 
     * The problem is that every time we create a ThresholdingVisitor instance, the method
     * ThreshdConfigFactory.interfaceInPackage is called. This methods uses JdbcFilterDao
     * to evaluate node filter.
     * 
     * This filter evaluation is the reason of why collectd take too much to initialize on
     * large networks when in-line thresholding is enabled.
     * 
     * From test log, you can see that JdbcFilterDao is invoked on each visitor creation
     * iteration.
