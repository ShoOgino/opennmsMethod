    /**
     * Process the event.
     * 
     * This event is generated when a managed node which supports SNMP gains a
     * new interface. In this situation the ThresholdableService object
     * representing the primary SNMP interface of the node must be
     * reinitialized.
     * 
     * The ThresholdableService object associated with the primary SNMP
     * interface for the node will be marked for reinitialization.
     * Reinitializing the ThresholdableService object consists of calling the
     * ServiceThresholder.release() method followed by the
     * ServiceThresholder.initialize() method which will refresh attributes such
     * as the interface key list and number of interfaces (both of which most
     * likely have changed).
     * 
     * Reinitialization will take place the next time the ThresholdableService
     * is popped from an interval queue for thresholding.
     * 
     * If any errors occur scheduling the service no error is returned.
     * 
     * @param event
     *            The event to process.
