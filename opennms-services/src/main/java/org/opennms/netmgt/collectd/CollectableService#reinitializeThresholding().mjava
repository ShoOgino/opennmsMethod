     * TODO Re-create or merge ?
     * 
     * The reason of doing a merge is to keep and update the threshold states.
     * 
     * It is extremely more easy to just recreate the thresholding visitor to avoid complex
     * operations. But, the cost of doing this is that all the states will be lost, and
     * some alarms will become orphans.
     * 
     * Other idea is to create two methods to get and set the states, and detect orphan
     * states. That way, we can decide what to do with orphans (like clear the alarm, or
     * send an auto-rearm), and also it can be used to persist the states across restarts.
