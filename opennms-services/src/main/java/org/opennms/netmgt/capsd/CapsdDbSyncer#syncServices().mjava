     * This method is responsible for sync'ing the content of the 'service'

     *
     * First a list of services currently contained in the 'service' table in
     * the database is built.
     *
     * Next, the list of services defined in capsd-configuration.xml is iterated
     * over and if any services are defined but do not yet exist in the
     * 'service' table they are added to the table.
     *
     * Finally, the list of services in the database is iterated over and if any
     * service exists in the database but is no longer listed in the
     * capsd-configuration.xml file then that the following occurs:
     *
     * 1. All 'outage' table entries which refer to the service are deleted. 2.
     * All 'ifServices' table entries which refer to the service are deleted.
     *
     * Note that the 'service' table entry will remain in the database since
     * events most likely exist which refer to the service.
