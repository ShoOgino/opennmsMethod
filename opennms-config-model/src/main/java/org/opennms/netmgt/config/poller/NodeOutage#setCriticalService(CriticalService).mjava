     * interface is DOWN.
     *  When an interface is DOWN only the critical service is
     * polled. If and
     *  when the critical service comes back UP then the
     * interface's other
     *  services are polled to determine their status. When an
     * interface is UP
     *  all services are polled as expected. If the critical
     * service goes DOWN,
     *  all services are considered to be DOWN and therefore the
     * interface is
     *  also considered DOWN.
