     * This method decides if a given time falls within the duty schedule
     * contained in this object. If so, it returns 0 milliseconds. If not
     * it returns the number of milliseconds until the next on-duty period
     * begins.
     * It creates two partial Calendars from the Calendar that is passed in
     * and then sets the start time for one and the end time for the other.
     * Then in a loop it reassigns the day of week according to the BitSet.
     * If the day is today, it makes a comparision of the argument Calendar
     * and the start and stop times to determine the return value. If the
     * day is not today it calculates the time between now and the day and
     * start time of the duty schedule, saving the smallest of these as the
     * return value as we iterate through the BitSet.???
