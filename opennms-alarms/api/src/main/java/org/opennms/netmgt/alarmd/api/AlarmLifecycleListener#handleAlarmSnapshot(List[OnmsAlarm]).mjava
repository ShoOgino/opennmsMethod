     * in the database.
     *
     * Note that it is possible that the *current* state of alarms is different from the state
     * at the time at which the snapshot was taken. Implementations should take this in consideration
     * when performing any state synchronization.

     * This method will be called while the related session & transaction that created
     * the alarm are still open.

     * All of the listeners are invoked serially, so the implementors should avoid
     * blocking when possible.
