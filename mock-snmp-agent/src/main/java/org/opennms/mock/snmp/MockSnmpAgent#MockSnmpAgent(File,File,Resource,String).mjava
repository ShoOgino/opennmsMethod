     * 		a file containing the boot counter in serialized form (as expected by BaseAgent).
     * @param confFile
     * 		a configuration file with serialized management information.
     * @param moFile
     * 		a MIB dump file describing the managed objects to be mocked.  The current implementation
     * 		expects a Java properties file, which can conveniently be generated using the Net-SNMP
     * 		utility <code>snmpwalk</code> with the <code>-One</code> option set.
