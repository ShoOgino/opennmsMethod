     * This method is the only one that is visible and not part of the ScriptEngineManager class.
     * Its purpose is to find new managers that weren't available before, but keeping the globalScope bindings
     * set.
     * If you want to clean the bindings you can either get a fresh instance of OSGiScriptManager or
     * setting up a new bindings object.
     * This can be done with:
     * <code>
     * ScriptEngineManager manager=new OSGiScriptEngineManager(context);
     * (...)//do stuff
     * osgiManager=(OSGiScriptEngineManager)manager;//cast to ease reading
     * osgiManager.reloadManagers();
     * 
     * manager.setBindings(new OSGiBindings());//or you can use your own bindings implementation
     * 
     * </code>   
     *
