     * method is invoked. The poll is passed the service to check.

     *
     * <P>
     * By default when the status transition from up to down or vice versa the
     * framework will generate an event. Additionally, if the polling interval
     * changes due to an extended unavailability, the framework will generate an
     * additional down event. The plug-in can suppress the generation of the
     * default events by setting the suppress event bit in the returned integer.
