     * This is a strange implementation, because intuitively, you would add the
     * header after the content has been produced (in other words, after you had
     * already called {@link FilterChain#doFilter FilterChain.doFilter}.
     * However, the Servlet 2.3 spec (proposed final draft) states (albeitly in
     * an off-handed fashion) that you can only "examine" the response headers
     * after the <code>doFilter</code> call. Evidently this means that you
     * cannot change the headers after the <code>doFilter</code>. If you call
     * <code>setHeader</code> nothing happens.
